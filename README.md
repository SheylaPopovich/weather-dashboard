## Directions for Future Development
The weather dashboard will also include a display of the searched city's projected five day forecast. This will display in addition to the current weather dashboard. There will be a feature enabling the user to save their recent searched cities for future reference. Lastly, their will be a UV index included on the current day dashboard that will indicate by color if the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
